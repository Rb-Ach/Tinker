## Problems
 - Detect hazards to stall the pipeline.
   - Could be solved with interdependent control signals and latching

## Notes:
 - We don't do unsigned operations

## Tasks
 - [ ] Extend multi-ported register file
 - [ ] Implement Devices with Unit tests
 - [ ] Create connections between Devices
 - [ ] Define control signals for instruction issue
 - [ ] Testing individual instructions
 - [ ] In-order execution with multiple instructions and testing
